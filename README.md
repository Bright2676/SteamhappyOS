# SteamhappyOS

## Current Version: v0.1.0

Hi!

**Please make sure to put the modules (Admins.lua, Commands.lua, and Settings.lua) inside of the main SteamhappyOS.lua file when in the Studio explorer.**

This is an in-development version of SteamhappyOS. It runs on the same premise of other admin systems on Roblox, having a prefix that is ran in chat followed by a command.
Ex: `;fly me`

The commands all follow the same args (arguments through the command), normally having the player that executed the command as one argument, and the target (mostly likely another player) as another string.

Ex: `commands.kill = function(playerExecuting, playerKill)`
